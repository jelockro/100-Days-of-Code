# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: In the process of moving fetch requests to service worker.  Stalled out at opening transaction on database. For some reasont he database is also consoling as null.

**Thoughts:** Very tired today.  Really look forward to solving this issue.

### Day 1: August 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Was able to access database and create transaction on it, as well as fetch the json data within the serviceWorker. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm getting very close to solving this piece.  Once I am done, I need to work on understanding how to use gulp and node and babel so that I can modularize my code and import the modules I need.  I know my code is not DRY, but once I get everything working I would like to focus on cleaning up the code and modularizing it.

### Day 2: August 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Was able to fetch assets out of indexedDB.  Still running into lots of bugs.

**Thoughts:** I thought I had the site up and running, and was running lighthouse audits, and then for some reason I am having database issues again.  I've spent the whole day debugging. Feeling a bit frustrated. I haven't pushed my commits yet, but will do tomorrow.

### Day 3: August 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I passed my lighthouse audit requirements and got my app working offline...kind of...

**Thoughts:** I presently am caching the database file that holds the idb code, which doesn't work for when I upgrade the database, and so I need to move that over to serviceworker. Started my first day in LaunchCode 101 class.  I am very excited and feel blessed that I have had these opportunities.

### Day 4: August 14, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: everything's broken

**Thoughts:** I tried to use too many tools.  I don't know how they all are supposed to work together, and I am running out of time.

### Day 5: August 15, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Making progress understanding browserify and starting to understand how bundling works.  But my project is quite broken.  I think I will need to step back and develope a simpler solution

### Day 6: August 16, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I was able to get the app working again.  At least the css is showing up again and the map works. Once i figure out how to bundle the databasehelper code so it has access to idb module, it should work again.

**Thoughts:** I made a good decision trying to revert to a simpler solution.  If I can get the project sent in, then I can work on learning things like babelify and making more complex script bundles.

### Day 7: August 17, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I got the app working and passed all tests, sent it in to review and passed with flying colors. Feeling very proud of myself. 

**Thoughts:** I am very eager to start refactoring? (not sure that is the word) the code so that I can take advantage of modularized javascript.  I think it would be helpful to do the broswerify tutorial and start with very simple scripts and experiment with bundling them, and then eventually start to break apart the scripts in my project to their components.

### Day 8: August 18, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some backend python server stuff.  

**Thoughts:** Not going to look at the restaurant app code this weekend.

### Day 9: August 19, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on assignments for launchcode using the python turtle library.  

**Thoughts:** Continued the part 3 learning in the udacity program.  Learned that with http/2 bundling & concatenating scripts is no longer be best practices.  HAH! Also learning about security.  I had been using public and private keys for cryptocurrencies and never realized the very concept was behind https.  I've just been using these tools without really understanding why or how they work.

### Day 10: August 20, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an assignment for launchcode using classes and class-inheritance.  A bit overkill for the requirements, but this is the first time I ever successfully built a class from scratch and it worked. I'm adding the code to my repo. Also created a ridiculous list splicing solution to a problem that was basically a three-liner using modulo.  

**Thoughts:** Solving the problems for the launchCode course is a lot more fun now that I have spent some time programming in python and javascript.  I think it's neat that I'm already starting to approach problems with an object-oriented perspective.  Probably due to the time spent in javascript.

### Day 11: August 23, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Learning Go and Dapp development.  https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/18 https://goethereumbook.org/ethereum-development-with-go.pdf
The last couple days I've been upgrading my laptop and working on a wordpress migration.

**Thoughts:** I need to get back to working on my restaurant survey app. I will still have time tonight to do that.  I'm just hitting a wall of interest.  I think what I will do is finish the survey app, and then dive into Go and Dapp development.

### Day 12: August 24, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I got my development environment ready for the third stage of the Udacity project.  I also found some svg's for the 1st part of the project which is adding favoriting capability.  I also learned a little about svg.  

**Thoughts:** I think SVG's are awesome, and I can't wait to play around with some css tricks and svg's. especially for some neat interactive homepages.  Alas, I have to work on this app and it is due in 15 days.  I wish I was more confident in implementing this stuff, but I guess that is why I am learning.
