# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 10, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: In the process of moving fetch requests to service worker.  Stalled out at opening transaction on database. For some reasont he database is also consoling as null.

**Thoughts:** Very tired today.  Really look forward to solving this issue.

### Day 1: August 11, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Was able to access database and create transaction on it, as well as fetch the json data within the serviceWorker. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm getting very close to solving this piece.  Once I am done, I need to work on understanding how to use gulp and node and babel so that I can modularize my code and import the modules I need.  I know my code is not DRY, but once I get everything working I would like to focus on cleaning up the code and modularizing it.

### Day 2: August 12, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Was able to fetch assets out of indexedDB.  Still running into lots of bugs.

**Thoughts:** I thought I had the site up and running, and was running lighthouse audits, and then for some reason I am having database issues again.  I've spent the whole day debugging. Feeling a bit frustrated. I haven't pushed my commits yet, but will do tomorrow.

### Day 3: August 13, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I passed my lighthouse audit requirements and got my app working offline...kind of...

**Thoughts:** I presently am caching the database file that holds the idb code, which doesn't work for when I upgrade the database, and so I need to move that over to serviceworker. Started my first day in LaunchCode 101 class.  I am very excited and feel blessed that I have had these opportunities.
