Styling my java application and working on routes

### R2D14 - 01-15-2019
A little bit of Java...well actually, xml

### R2D15 - 01-16-2019
Updating all my repositories on github..that means all the links in here will be broken :( Merging repos isn't the easiest.  I have a lot more work to do, but going to try out Subtree Merging. I would like all my udacity classes to be subtrees of one udacity repository, and then all the original repos can be private.  I also need to prepare for a technical interview, so I want to limit the rest of the time I spend on merging repos to one hour tomorrow.
