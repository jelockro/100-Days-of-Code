### R2D11 - 01-10-2019
Started working on ClientPanel, another Angular App, and java for launchcode

### R2D12 - 01-11-2019

### R2D13 - 01-14-2019
Styling my java application and working on routes

### R2D14 - 01-15-2019
A little bit of Java...well actually, xml

### R2D15 - 01-16-2019
Updating all my repositories on github..that means all the links in here will be broken :( Merging repos isn't the easiest.  I have a lot more work to do, but going to try out Subtree Merging. I would like all my udacity classes to be subtrees of one udacity repository, and then all the original repos can be private.  I also need to prepare for a technical interview, so I want to limit the rest of the time I spend on merging repos to one hour tomorrow.  

### R2D16 - 01-17-2019
I was successful at using subtree merging to consolidate some of my repositories. It's a tedious process, but I like that I can keep a repository private but add it as a subtree to a something else if it becomes important.  Was stuck with model binding for my java project.  I didn't have setters generated for my model, and spring relies on them. These types of problems can be frustrating, but I learn a lot from them.

### R2D17 - 01-18-2019
[added 01-22] On Friday I spent the day studying data structure for my upcoming technical interview.  I wrote code in Java for tries.

### R2D18 - 01-20-2019
[added 01-22] On Sunday I continued working with data structures, linked-lists, stacks, and queues.  I pushed my work to https://github.com/jelockro/technical-interview-study


### R2D19 - 01-21-2019
[added 01-22] On Monday I continued working with data structures including hash-tables and read a lot of java documentation, and tried my hand at some example coding questions.
I pushed my work to https://github.com/jelockro/technical-interview-study

### R2D20 - 01-22-2019
I have updated my goal to 11 commits a day. I really like that shade of green on the github commit map.
